## About me! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science graduate currently working in Windows-based Corporate IT Infrastructure.
University has granted me experience in Java, React, JS and Python. My current professional role is heavily based on PowerShell & Groovy (Java) for automation, as well as common infra-as-code languages such as yaml.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I also love dogs, roller skating & video games.
  
### Actively ongoing...
- ðŸ”­ My current creative outlet is solo game development, primarily using C# for my current projects in the Unity engine, with a focus on good programming design principals; writing extensible, re-usable code. It's important to lay good foundations for the rest of the project after all!
- ðŸŒ± Learning how to use Jenkins and Docker for Infrastructure Automation, dabbling in a bit of Kubernetes!

### Past Projects!
- ðŸŒ± Python for Data Science with HyperionDev! Creating and analysing various Machine Learning models on large data sets with Pandas, Matplotlib and other popular ML Python libraries.
- ðŸ”­ WIP - Web project using React and Firebase for a Community Network service
