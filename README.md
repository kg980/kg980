## About me! 👋
I'm a Computer Science graduate currently working in Windows-based Corporate IT Infrastructure.
My time at University was mostly spent with Java, React, JS and Python. My current professional role is heavily based on PowerShell & Groovy for automation, as well as common infra-as-code file types JSON, CSVs & Yaml.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I also love dogs, roller skating & video games.
- Latest hobby: 3d modelling, rigging & animating models
  
### Actively ongoing...
- 🔭 My current passion project: solo game development! Primarily using C# with Unity engine & GDScript with Godot. This comes with some super fun challenges, balancing good programming design principals with scope creep and prototyping time constraints. Laying strong foundations with extensible, re-usable code which allows me to connect many small problems into one maintainable system.
- 🌱 SQL Data Warehouse project - Developing an ETL pipeline to ingest data from a source and transform it into business-ready views using SQL, SQL Server and SQL Management Studio
- 🌱 Learning how to use Jenkins and Docker for Infrastructure Automation, dabbling in a bit of Kubernetes!

### Past Projects
- 🌱 Python for Data Science with HyperionDev: creating and analysing various Machine Learning models on large data sets with Pandas, Matplotlib and other popular ML Python libraries.
- 🔭 WIP - POC Web project using React and Firebase for a Community Network service
